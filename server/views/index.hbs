            I am a conscientious person who works hard and pays attention to detail. I'm flexible, quick to pick up new skills and eager to learn from others that gives you the versatility to place me in a number of contexts with confidence that the level of excellence
            you expect will be met. I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. Also I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and more. As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.

                    If I would have had to take one thing from this job, it would be JavaScript. While most of the web devs (including myself) assume they know it already because they studied computer science and have coded in C++ or Java, its not the case. Its really powerful
                    and interesting language, but one has to actually spend some time to learn it. I was involved with their flagship product Metasys UI. JavaScript was the meal of the day wrapped around CSS, SVG, XSLT, AngularJS. Growing from a novice
                    developer, I had a significant hand in developing -

                    College was an experiment. I took courses in various discipline - computer science, electronics, communications. The data structure and algorithm, networks and programming courses I took, defined my career choice. Web 2.0 was the talk of the town and
                    I jumped in. Building web sites turned to be my favorite pass time. I was also intrigued by machine learning and data science.
